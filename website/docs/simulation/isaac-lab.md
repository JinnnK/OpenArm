# Isaac Lab

## Summarization

Welcome to the OpenArm Isaac Lab Simulation Documentation.

We are currently developing reinforcement learning and imitation learning applications using the OpenArm model within the Isaac Sim/Lab environment. To support this, we are working on simple simulation and sim2real integration code.

All developed code will be released as open source.
